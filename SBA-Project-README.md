<h3>My Climbing Blog Simple Website</h3>

<h4>Summary:</h4>
<p>This site consists of three pages with the exact same layout. There are links in the center of the page which work to bring the user around the site, and a dropdown to external sites. The user will see a few forms throughout the site which do not work yet. The structure is made and there is a quick onclick function saying thank you, but the forms themselves do not function.</p>
<p>The landing page is introducing the user to the layout, providing a quick summary of purpose,  describing myself, and has an invitation to find out more. There is also a poor attempt at humor.</p>
<p>There is a stats page where sample climbing statistics are listed in a set of two tables. The first table shows my climbing Personal bests, and the second table shows a community leaderboard. There is also a form at the end of the page for a user to submit there own climb to be listed.</p>
<p>The contact us page has a simple form to be submitted by the user with name email and a textbox for content.  There is placeholder text explaining the forms do not currently function.</p>
